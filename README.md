# Healthcare Access Gaps in Nairobi – Case Study

## Project Overview

This case study explores healthcare access gaps in Nairobi County, with a focus on **primary healthcare services** (Level 2). The goal is to support **strategic resource allocation** by identifying **underserved areas** and highlighting the role of both **availability** and **affordability** in determining true access to care.

This case study challenges the assumption that **“more facilities = more access”** by accounting for population needs and affordability barriers.

It provides a strategic starting point for Nairobi County health planning and shows how data-driven approaches can guide equitable, impactful investment in healthcare.
